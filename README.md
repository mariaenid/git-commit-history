## Run App

We have two apps, one for frontend called cloud and one called api. I am using nx to create an integrated monorepo for the apps.
They are built using React and NestJs respectively

## Install dependencies

Do you need install docker and set a .env with your own credentials. See an example on .env.template, then run:

`npm install`

## Install dockerUser docker to init a database and init a login app

`docker compose up -d`

## Run api and cloud app

`npm run start:api`

`npm run start:cloud`

# Ports Running

- Api starts an application running on 3000 port. You can reach using http://localhost:3000/graphql

- Cloud starts an application running on 4200 port. You can reach using http://localhost:4200

# Test

- Run unit test for the api

`npm run test:api`
